# Huebrick-smart-lamp
This is a smart lamp that is created in the way that it can be upgraded at any time but still used by a normal user.

What does that mean?

That means that you can buy this lamp and use it like any other smart home product but if you are skilled enough you can download all files from here and order them from (probably) China and assemble it by yourself. 

Where does this project shine?

Well, the best part is that if you want to add for example humidity sensor or a light sensor you can do that if you want to redesign the boost circuit you can do that. Then the price is even better which is around $60 and at that price, it beats Philips hue lamp and any other lamps at that price range and even at higher price ranges.

Why should i care?

Well if you are reading this you probably have a smartphone and if I'm right you probably have at least one voice assistant(amazon Alexa, google assistant, Siri, etc.)  you can control some smart home appliances, for example, you can say to Amazon Alexa:"Alexa turn off the heater and turn on lights in the kitchen" and it's getting more popular. The second reason why you should care is that this is a led lamp so power saving is always a good bonus.

What are some of the features of this lamp?

- It can be connected to an Amazon Alexa
- Brightness is around 400 lumens 
- Has a speaker and can be accessed by a Bluetooth
- Acts like a low-resolution screen (around 100 addressable LEDs)
- Can be controlled by a smartphone (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) , manually over buttons on the lamp, can be controlled with a small RF remote
- Can play animations (example use: animation of a fire)
- Has a battery pack inside (around 5 hours with the maximum current draw)
- Usb charging 
- Has a modern and minimalistic look
- Upgradable
- many more coming

How do upgrades work?

It is based on an Arduino chip (atmega328) and ESP8266 (also Arduino ide compatible) so if you have some knowledge in Arduino programming you can add a servo motor that turns the lamp 360 degrees if you want. You can buy some sensors form (probably) China and add it to your lamp or you can redesign the app for it so it has much more functionality. This lamp is all about price/feature ratio and upgradability.

Why is it open source?

Well if I was the only person that makes this first of all it would not be good and second of all if I ever get bored of the project it can still live on without me. And last, of all, there are business possibilities in this for you, for example, you can download the plans and start producing your lamps and selling them if you want to do that.
