# Huebrick-POWER


Now Huebrick POWER, for now, is just a test but there will be a finished PCB that you will be able to buy later but for now, it is in an experimental stage, so if you want to build it do it at your own risk because you are playing with mains voltage.

---Now, what is Huebrick POWER?

Huebrick POWER is a Huebrick standard mains switch. What that means is that it is a mains ac switch that can be controlled by your phone with the same app whit which you control the smart lamp. 

---Why does Huebrick POWER exist?

Huebrick POWER exists because Huebrick will no longer be just a smart lamp but an open-source Smart-home brand and a standard aswell. So we are going out and making other smart-home devices.

---When will Huebrick-POWER be available?

For now, you will only be able to build it yourself. Why? Because making products that control mains power you need to do a lot of work to get certifications. So expect it if everything goes right in the next year or later.

---How is Huebrick-POWER meant to be used?

The cheaper and smaller version is intended to behind your power outlet but there will be a bigger version that you will be able to plug into your outlet and use it as "smart pass-through" outletâ€‹. It's going to be your choice which one you chose. Now the "pass-through" will probably have a manual switch override and the smaller version will have a place where you can plug a switch so you can bypass electronics so if you don't want to use your phone you will still be able to use it.


---That's it for now but I'm going to keep working on this but my main priority is the lamp.
